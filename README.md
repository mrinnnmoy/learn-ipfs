<p>Introduction to IPFS</p>
<ul>
    <li>IPFS (InterPlanatery File System) is a peer-to-peer, decentraliszed and distributed file-system.</li>
    <li>It uses DHT (Distributed Hash Table) and Merkle DAG (Directed Acylic Graph) data structures.</li>
    <li>It uses a protocol similar to Bit Torrent to decide how to move data around the network.</li>
    <li>It uses Content Addressing rather than Location Addressing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why use IPFS?</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Storing and distributing data with IPFS saves bandwidth by retrieving data from multiple peers at once. A user requests content based on its unique CID, IPFS retrieves that data based on the CID from multiple nodes at once, and it is then delivered to the user in the quickest, most efficient way possible.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages of IPFS over HTTP</p>
<ul>
    <li>Content Addressing.</li>
    <li>No one controls it.</li>
    <li>Efficient.</li>
    <li>Data is persistent.</li>
    <li>Cannot go down.</li>
</ul>
